# UniProt Introduction Exercises

## Aim

1. Hands-on experience of navigating around the UniProt entry pages
2. An introduction to simple searches within UniProt

## What you need

Your browser open at: uniprot.org

__All exercises are based upon the UniProt Entry – P00740 (FA9_HUMAN)__


## Part 1: Basic Navigation

### Introduction
A UniProt entry page is divided into separate sections providing specific types of information. The best way to navigate around is to use the short-cut menu on the left.
On the uniprot.org home page in the ‘Google like’ search bar enter P00740 and goto the entry page.

__Questions:__
1. What is the gene name of P00740?
2. How does this differ from the protein name?
3. How many sequences are reported for this entry and what are their lengths?
4. Which sequence are all the annotations based upon?
5. In the cell where is this protein found? (trick question)
6. What type of annotation is this from?
7. How many X-Ray structures are reported from PDBe?


## Part 2: Functional Annotation (Features)

__Questions:__

1. How many diseases are annotated in P00740 and what is/are their name(s)?

2. What annotations can you find at or overlapping residue 283?

3. Are any of the annotations associated to a disease(s)?

4. Using the other annotations can you conclude what has happened to the protein to cause the disease?

5. Are there any protein structures that cover residue 283 and does it help in your interpretation?


## Part 3: Basic searching

__From the UniProt home page (uniprot.org)__

__Questions:__

1. Is there a way to look for related (orthologs) proteins of P00740?
*__Hint:__ Look at the top of the P00740 page*


2. Which is the more consistent search? 



3. Why do you think this is the case?
*__Hint:__ How do you think the UniProt search is working.*
